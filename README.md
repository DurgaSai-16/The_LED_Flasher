# THE LED FLASHER :page_with_curl:

* **Aim:**  **LED Flasher** using Arduino UNO

* **Appartus:**
    * Bread Board
    * LED
    * Resistor (200Ω - 1kΩ)
    * Jumper Wires
    * Arduino UNO

* **Sofware used:**
  * [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/dashboard) for Online Simulation
  * Download [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and write the program required for the cicuit and Upload to it Arduino UNO using USB cable
  * You can also try this online without downloading just by singing up here [Arduino IDE Online](https://create.arduino.cc/editor)
* **Circuit Diagram:** <img width="888" alt="LED Flasher" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85128689/122908056-58d43700-d371-11eb-9c79-cbeb1cc8900d.png">

* **Procedure:** (For Hardware)
  1. Make the connections as per circuit diagram.
  2. Open the Arduino IDE software.
  3. Click on file and then click on new to create a new sketch file.
  4. [Code](https://github.com/DurgaSai-16/The_LED_Flasher/blob/main/Code) the Arduino UNO to control LED Flasher.
  5. Connect Arduino UNO to computer.
  6. Click on tools and then click on board and select Arduino UNO.
  7. Now, select correct serial port by clicking on Tools and then Serial Port select required Port.
  8. Here comes the sweet simple finishing simple step "click the upload button".
* **Procedure:** (For Software simulation)
  1. Open [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/dashboard)
  2. Select "Circuits" there.
  3. Make the connections as per circuit diagram.
  4. Click on code button and then Blocks select one(Blocks, Blocks+Text,Text) to [Code](https://github.com/DurgaSai-16/The_LED_Flasher/blob/main/Code) ![FlasherCircuit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85128689/123168795-148e8700-d496-11eb-8402-0b54636e5f5d.jpeg)
  5. Finish it off in style by clicking on Start simulation to observe the output.

* **Observation:** The LED in circuit is obsereved be to turn ON and OFF (i.e., Blinking)for regular interval of time.

* **Result:** Hence, LED Flasher is designed, coded and controlled using Arduino UNO.
* **Precautions:**
  * Avoid loose connections.
  * Don't give power supply before start of experiment.

 * **Applications:** 
   * Warning Device.
   * Signaling for help when you're in danger.
   * Indication Signs on National Highways.
   * Parking lights for car etc,.
   * Decoration.

* **More information:**
* LED Flasher is basic circuit need to be known to learner of Arduino and IoT (it is similar to Hello World program in programming languages).
* Other names: Blinking LED, Blinky, LED Oscillator, Blinker, etc,.
